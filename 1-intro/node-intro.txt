js can't be run directly on our computer
   can run on browser becuse of the v8 engine
v8 engine compiles js into machine code

# nodejs
nodejs is written in c++ 
v8 engine is included node
it can run directily into our computer(server)
input to node -> js , output of node -> machine code
node is not just a wrapper for v8 engine
it adds more features and functionality to js
ex: read & write files on a computer
	connect to datatbase
	act as a server for content

also lose features of js like DOM ()
can't interact with html elements anymore

# role of node.js: 
browser make some kind of request to the node server
node server runs some kind of js to react to the request 
(then do sth like connect to database)
formulate some kind of response and send them back to the browser(ex:
	html page with dynamic data inside it
	some css
	img files
	...
) 

# benifits of node :
no need to learn an extra language for server(same language js)
can share code between front end and back end
node.js has a massive community behind it
huge amount of thrid-party pkgs and tooks to help
