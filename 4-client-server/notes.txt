server side is powered by node and js
            listening for incoming requests from the browser

----------------------                    ------------------
   browser            -                    -    server
url (website address)-  --------->------- -
                     -                    -   node.js
                     -  ---------<------- -
                     -                    -  
----------------------                    ------------------

1.enter website address / domain name to the browser
2.browser sends a request to the server that powering this website
3.the server looks for this request and decide what to send back to 
  the browser (inn most cases: HTML pages(others imgs - json - ..)) and send it
4.the HTML page is dispalyed in the browser

# How the browser knows the correct server to send the request?! 
first lets know more about ip addresses and port node


# IP address:

    -all computers connected to the internet have a unique ip address
    -hosts: computers that host websites on the internet
    -so if we need to connnect a server on a host computer , 
     firat,  know its ip address,
     enter it to the browser.
    -ip : series of numbers ( hard to remember )
        instead we use "domain names" to mask these ip addresses

    -domain name is associated with the corresponding ip address

# Sending req and geting response :

                           GET Request
----------------------                             ------------------
   browser           -  look up the ip address     -    host
                     -   assoc with that domain,   -            
url (domain name)    -  --------->---------------- -
                     -  use ip to connect          - 
                     - to the server with          -
                     -  that host computer         -           
                     -                             -

            "communication via HTTP typer-text transfer protocol"

get request : made to get certain resouce (ex : HTML page) from the server
post request : made to send data to the server(from web form for ex)

the communication between them is via HTTP typer-text transfer protocol
HTTP : set of instructions which tells how communication occurs
       like human communictation => languages
