some modules are built in the core of node , ex: os - fs - ...

other pkgs that users 've made we can still use them
 ex:  utility lib, date/time lib , frameworks(Express), ..
 we can install them with npm 
 npm is automatically installed with node
 npm is a tool to install, update or remove pkgs into our computer and also into our individual projects to use


 1.nodemon:
    is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications
    by automatically restarting the node application when 
    file changes in the directory are detected.

node install -g nodemon : globally install nodemon in our computer

pkg file (package.json) : -json file that keeps track of any pkgs being installed locally to our project in addition to proj details and so on
                          -shortly keeps track of our project dependences
                          - allow to share all project codes without uploading node_module folder:
                            u just enter npm install in the termainal and it looks in the pkg.json file in dependences
                            and install all of them

dependences : pkgs installed to a specific project, so it depneds on 

used a 3rd party pkg ? u should create pkg file by "npm init"

pkg-lock.json -> keeps track of different dependences versions we 've installed in our project
              
2.lodash
npm i --save lodash
i => install shortcut
--save => save it to our local dependences for this project (not globally)
--save is used for old versions of node otherwise u may not type it if u 've a recent version


# after installing a pkg locally a node_module folder appers
 which include folders and dependences needed by this pkg
 -do NOT upload this huge folder if u share ur project (like in gitHub)
