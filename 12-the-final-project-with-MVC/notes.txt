MVC : model, view, controller
      a way of structuring our code & files
      keeps code more modular, reusable & easier to read

views: where we create html templetes
models: how we describe our data structure and use them to interact with the database
controllers: forms the link between our models and views 

route files matches incomming requests and passes them to the correct controller function
a controller communicates with the appropriate model to get data into a view 
and the view then renders that data into its template and it gets sent to the browser
