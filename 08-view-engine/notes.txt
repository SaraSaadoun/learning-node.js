view engine or templete engine(in express)
allow to inject dynamic data and logic into html like variables

different templete engines that works in express:
1.express handlebar
2.pug
3.EJS (will use this)

EJS :
    tags : <% some js that runs in the server side%>
           <%= %>  >>>>> output
    pass data into ejs files by passing object as the 2nd argument
    to the .send method, then use field name in ejs file
    ex: in js file : res.render("about", { title: "About" });
        in ejs file: <title>Blogs | <%= title%></title>

Server Side Rendering:

              -----------------
EJS files -> |EJS view engine  | -> HTML page -----> pass it to the browser
              -----------------
