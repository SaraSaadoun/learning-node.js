middleware : code which runs (on the server) between getting a request and sending a response

            we could have multiple pieces of middleware running on the server

middleware examples:
1-logger middleware to log details of every request
2-authentication check middleware for protected routes
3-to parse json data from requests
4-return 404 pages


-middleware functions are made for us to use

-use a 3rd party middleware called morgan which is a login

-the server protects all of our files automatically
from users in a browser , so they can't just access 
any of our files

-so we specify what files to be public and what not
-use=> express.static(folder_name) // anything in that file will be available as a static to the front end:
app.use(express.static('public'));
-u can put imgs,  css , ... in the public folder that are accessable from the browser
