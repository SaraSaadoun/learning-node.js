connect to db using for ex:
1- plain mongodb api and pkg
2- mongoose to connect and interact with db

mongoose is an ODM library - Object Document Mapping library

mongoose ----->User Model
         ----->Blog Model
         ----->Comment Model
         ...
         ...
         
         for each collection in ur db

so, u can use methods like find, findById, ....., etc
for ex: User.findById() find some user by the give id in the users collection using User model

# mongoose handles the conversion of ObjectId of _id into strings for us
